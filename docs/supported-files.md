# Supported File Formats

This plugin works with any file that can be opened using KOReader's
**ReaderPaging** system.

At the time of writing, [these](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/blob/c6b1eb9ffa47f27d8c7bc8703453cb8d149024d9/frontend/document/pdfdocument.lua#L361-L404) file formats are supported by this system.

To force a file to open with this system, press and hold on the file, then choose

## Recommendations

- For comics, it is recommended to use the `CBZ` or `CBR` file formats.
- For other documents where dual-page viewing is desired, use PDF.

Reading comics in EPUB format is **not recommended**, as it does not provide a good reading experience.

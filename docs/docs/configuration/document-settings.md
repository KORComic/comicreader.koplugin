# Document Settings

**Note:** To interact with these settings, you need to be in **dual page mode**.

There are three settings that can be saved **per document**:

1. Reading Direction
2. First Page as Cover
3. Automatic Enablement

## Where to Find the Settings

With a paged document (PDF, CBZ, etc.) open, these settings appear in the **top menu**, on the **second icon**:

## Reading Direction

**Right-to-Left (RTL)**

By default, pages are displayed in order: `page1|page2`. This works perfectly for **left-to-right (LTR)** documents.

For RTL documents, where the correct order is `page2|page1`, toggle the **RTL setting**. This ensures your pages display in the proper sequence.

## First Page as Cover

Some documents start with a cover page that should be shown on its own.

- Enable **First Page as Cover** if this applies to your document.
- If not enabled, pages will shift by one, resulting in something like:
`cover|page1` ` page2|page3`
- Enabling it will show the cover separately:
`cover page1|page2`

Use this setting to match the layout you prefer.

## Automatic Enablement

**Auto Enable**

Turn this on to have **dual page mode** automatically activate when your device is in **landscape orientation**.  
This makes reading wider documents effortless without manual toggling.
